This recipe for the famous Beijing dish, consisting of juicy slices of duck with crispy skin, is served with Mandarin pancakes and hoisin sauce. The recipe states that you need to hang the duck in a cool, windy place for four hours; this is to make sure the duck is completely dry, inside and out, so it will get nice and crispy. If you don't have the proper place to hang the duck, you can place it in a cool room with a fan blowing on it.",
